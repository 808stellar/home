<h3> Refund Policy </h3>

<p>
  Refunds will not be issued after delivery has been completed. Since there is no way to return your product, as it is a digital
  file and can be copied, refunds are not possible. Refunds may be issued before delivery, but can not be guaranteed. Any refund requests can be requested using
  the refund form linked below.
