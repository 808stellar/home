<h3> Terms and Conditions </h3>
<p>
  Any instrumentals purchased can not be re-sold or copied to other people. When leasing an instrumental, you do not own the rights to
	that instrumental. All rights belong to 808STELLAR. You can use your instrumental as described below. You can order on behalf
	of somebody else, but it can not be transferred to anybody. All instrumentals are protected by Copyright laws in the United States of
	America and all other countries with similar laws. Product delivery can be expected within 2 weeks for a custom instrumental, and 5 days
	for a pre-made instrumental. There are no guarantees on delivery times. Delivery in general within a reasonable amount of time IS
	guaranteed. Prices/products are subject to change but will not affect any previous orders.
</br></br>
	Tagged Instrumental:
</br>
After purchase, you can use a tagged instrumental for one publication. You can not cut the tag out of the track. You can put (prod. 808STELLAR) in the
title of the track, but it is not necessary.

</br></br>
	Un-Tagged Instrumental:
</br>
After purchase, you can use an un-tagged instrumental for one publication. You can put (prod. 808STELLAR) in the
title of the track, but it is not necessary.

</br></br>
	Custom Instrumental:
</br>
	After purchase, you can use a custom instrumental for one publication. Since you will be getting your own instrumental, nobody
else can purchase said instrumental. You also do not gain rights to the instrumental just because you ordered it custom. All custom
instrumentals arrive untagged. You may put (prod. 808STELLAR) in the title of your song to promote my page, but that is not necessary.

<h3> Refund Policy </h3>
<p>
  Refunds will not be issued after delivery has been completed. Since there is no way to return your product, as it is a digital
  file and can be copied, refunds are not possible. Refunds may be issued before delivery, but can not be guaranteed. Any refund requests can be requested using
  the refund form linked below.
